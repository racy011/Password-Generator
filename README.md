# Password-Generator
The password generator script is designed to create strong and customizable passwords. The user inputs the desired number of letters, numbers, and symbols. The script then randomly selects characters from predefined lists for each category and combines them to form the password. This method ensures the inclusion of diverse character types, making the password more secure. By generating passwords with varying lengths and character sets, it offers flexibility and randomness, enhancing protection against common hacking techniques.
